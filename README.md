# SpatialPlanner
A tool for creating spatial plans

This is an exercise full stack project.

The idea is to create an app that contains / allows / does

* A map

* Users

* User to create types for areas

* User to delineate areas

* User can bring into the map view areas of selected types and of selected users

* The app updates itself

The idea is to create an app that can be used to e.g., create a
simulation of a situation room that follows delineation of
contaminated area and locations of nature or other values the
contamination threatens, and protection measures carried out.
